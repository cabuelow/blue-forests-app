### Blue Forest App

Web application to inform blue forest conservation.

Prototype [here](https://global-wetlands.shinyapps.io/blue-forests-app/)

#### TODO

- [ ] More specific labels for criteria and indicator plots

- [ ] Tidy up code!

- [ ] Fix Fiji, New Zealand zoom problem

- [ ] Problems with data quality scores, tnc fish catch, coastal protection, seagrass carbon - global and provincial averages

- [ ] Remove area suitable for seaweed farming, TNC fisheries layer, and Eger data for now.

#### Decisions decisions

- [ ] Map at fine scale or coarse-scale?

- [ ] Include all individual indicator layers? e.g. land vs. climate threats, spp. richness, etc.? Could show both prototypes at consultation and see if its necessary?

#### Wish List

- [ ] Pick your own threats indicators (e.g., land vs climate, prob of decline, etc)

#### Data/Analysis updates 

- [ ] Use Duarte 2022 seaweed distribution (will involve reprocessing all seaweed layers to this distribution, including threats :( )
- [ ] Get updated TNC mang fisheries enhancement layer when ready
- [ ] Get final seaweed farming layer when published
- [ ] Get final Eger kelp data when published
- [ ] Cyclone tracks - buffer by gale force wind radius
