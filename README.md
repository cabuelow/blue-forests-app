### Blue Forest App

Web application to inform blue forest conservation.

Prototype [here](https://global-wetlands.shinyapps.io/blue-forests-app/)

#### TODO

- [ ] Need info buttons for criteria and indicators - e.g. what is kelp carbon?

- [ ] Filter by project size (i.e., small vs large)

- [ ] screenshot tool for printing dashboards etc, also data export?

- [ ] Enabling condition page - so can see indicators underpinning
 
#### From 1st end-user consulation - ideas

- [ ] Allow jurisdictional boundaries to be turned on, e.g., country-borders

- [ ] Allow to zoom to specific regions, e.g., SWIO, or have different pages for different regions?

- [ ] Link to NDC database - which countries have BF NDC's?

- [ ] Point people to where they can get more info about a project - i.e., contact a project manager

#### Data/Analysis updates 

- [ ] Use Duarte 2022 seaweed distribution (will involve reprocessing all seaweed layers to this distribution, including threats :( )
- [ ] Get updated TNC mang fisheries enhancement layer when ready
- [ ] Get final seaweed farming layer when published
- [ ] Get final Eger kelp data when published
- [ ] Cyclone tracks - buffer by gale force wind radius
