### Blue Forest App

Web application to inform blue forest conservation.

Prototype [here](https://global-wetlands.shinyapps.io/blue-forests-app/)

#### TODO

- [ ] More specific labels for criteria and indicator plots

- [ ] Fix Fiji, New Zealand zoom problem

- [ ] Problems with data quality scores, tnc fish catch, coastal protection, seagrass carbon - global and provincial averages

- [ ] Have data export options/screen shot options
 
#### From 1st end-user consulation - ideas

- [ ] Allow jurisdictional boundaries to be turned on, e.g., country-borders

- [ ] Allow to zoom to specific regions, e.g., SWIO, or have different pages for different regions?

- [ ] Link to NDC database - which countries have BF NDC's?

- [ ] Impact metrics - subset of inofrmation we want people to submit on tracking projects

- [ ] Point people to where they can get more info about a project - i.e., contact a project manager

- [ ] Be able to filter by project size (i.e., small vs large)

- [ ] If possible, more indicators on livelihoods

- [ ] Track changes from baseline, show increase or decreases in indicators over time

#### Data/Analysis updates 

- [ ] Use Duarte 2022 seaweed distribution (will involve reprocessing all seaweed layers to this distribution, including threats :( )
- [ ] Get updated TNC mang fisheries enhancement layer when ready
- [ ] Get final seaweed farming layer when published
- [ ] Get final Eger kelp data when published
- [ ] Cyclone tracks - buffer by gale force wind radius
