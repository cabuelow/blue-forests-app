### Blue Forest App

Web application to inform blue forest conservation.

#### TODO for first end-user consultation

1. - [X] Fix glitches
      - [ ] Timing out issue – increase server ‘instance’ period, greater than 15 minutes

2. - [ ] Re-write app in leaflet (lose some speed compared to mapdeck, trade-off for features)
  - In progress - slider isn't working
        
3. - [X] On-click pop-ups

4. - [X] Allow to switch on or off enabling constraint layer

5. - [ ] Incorporate data gap-filling information as layers to switch on/off

6. - [X] Have WWF projects and investment feasibility as a switch on or off in every tab

7. - [ ] Remove area suitable for seaweed farming, TNC fisheries layer, and Eger data for now.

8. - [ ] Ideally, select different combinations of ecosystems and criteria, and get top locations

9. - [X] Update with final master dataframe from remote server

10. - [ ] Fix Fiji zoom problem

11. Write an instructions tab

#### Decisions decisions

- [ ] Map individual layers at fine-scale resolution, but hotspots at coarse scale? 

#### Data/Analysis updates 

- [ ] Use Duarte 2022 seaweed distribution (will involve reprocessing all seaweed layers to this distribution, including threats :( )
- [ ] Get updated TNC mang fisheries enhancement layer when ready
- [ ] Get final seaweed farming layer when published
- [ ] Get final Eger kelp data when published
- [ ] Cyclone tracks - buffer by gale force wind radius
