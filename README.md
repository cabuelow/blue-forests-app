### Blue Forest App

Web application to inform blue forest conservation.

Prototype [here](https://global-wetlands.shinyapps.io/blue-forests-app/)

#### TODO

- [ ] tidy code!
- [ ] Threshold for selection of man units, say Top 10%, is that always of global units, or does it recalculate if National Context box is ticked at bottom of page? Could edit Tour explanation to make clear.
- [ ] set up adoption use: https://appsilon.com/monitoring-r-shiny-user-adoption/
Front page:
- [ ] Make a technical 'Before you launch the app' box that has 'app needs time to warm up', data issues, etc.
 
#### From 1st end-user consulation - ideas

- [ ] Filter by project size (i.e., small vs large)

- [ ] Allow jurisdictional boundaries to be turned on, e.g., country-borders

- [ ] Allow to zoom to specific regions, e.g., SWIO, or have different pages for different regions?

- [ ] Link to NDC database - which countries have BF NDC's?

- [ ] Point people to where they can get more info about a project - i.e., contact a project manager

- [ ] Enabling conditions page so can see indicators

- [ ] screenshot tool for printing dashboards etc, also data export?

#### Data/Analysis updates 

- [ ] Use Duarte 2022 seaweed distribution (will involve reprocessing all seaweed layers to this distribution, including threats :( )
- [ ] Get updated TNC mang fisheries enhancement layer when ready
- [ ] Get final seaweed farming layer when published
- [ ] Get final Eger kelp data when published
- [ ] Cyclone tracks - buffer by gale force wind radius
